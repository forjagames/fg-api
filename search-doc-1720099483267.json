While we strive for accuracy, the information presented here may not be 100% precise or reflect the current calculation methods. We recommend consulting the billing page or reaching out to our support team for the latest and most accurate information regarding cost calculations.  To ensure the calculation remains independent of the number of days in the month, we employ the following formula:  Precise Daily Cost (PDC) = (Total Monthly Cost of all Projects) * 12 / 365   This yields a decimal-rich result.  To round the value, we utilize the following formula:  Final Daily Cost (FDC) = Round(PDC * (10 ^ 8)) / (10 ^ 8)   For example, if the monthly cost of all your projects is $2.5:  PDC = 2.5 * 12 / 365 = 0.08219178082191780821917808219178 FDC = Round(PDC * (10 ^ 8)) / (10 ^ 8) = 8219178 / (10 ^ 8) = 0.08219178 Final Daily Cost = 0.08219178   At the end of the month, the monthly cost of each project is determined by summing the consumption measured on each day. Then, the total for each project is rounded to two decimal places, and added, to determine the total invoice cost.

I reserved 1gb size in storage service, but in overview I see 1 GB used. Why?​  This happens because the reserved space on the drives counts as used, because you block a portion of the ssd from our servers.  2. I reserved 1gb of storage, but in overview I see 1 GB used / 1.1 GB. Why is the 1.1 GB shown?​  To understand this, there are two concepts to consider.  2.1. First, we use a partitioning system where storage space is reserved in 0.1 GB increments. For example, if you use 1 GB of space and then require an additional 10 MB, an extra 0.1 GB portion will be reserved for you to store those 10 MB. If you then require another 10 MB, it will use the remaining space in that reserved portion until it is used up.  2.2. Second, the storage size we display includes not only databases and drives that you create in our services, but also the space required by each entity associated with your projects, such as registered users, logs, products, etc. These entities typically require only a few bytes or kilobytes of storage.  Therefore, the additional space you see reserved is due to these entities, and it's normal to see a small amount of additional space shown in the overview.

This ensures a seamless and hassle-free payment experience, especially if your account has sufficient credit to cover the incurred charges.  Here's how it works:  Enabled: When this option is set to enabled, Nexus will automatically deduct the necessary funds from your account credit to settle outstanding invoices. This includes charges associated with your selected plan as well as any additional fees that may arise from exceeding the usage limits of your plan. If the account credit is insufficient to cover the total charges, Nexus will prioritize other configured payment methods, ensuring uninterrupted service. Disabled: Setting this option to disabled means that automatic payments using account credit will be disabled. However, keep in mind that other configured automatic payment methods, such as subscription payments through PayPal, will continue to operate as usual. In such cases, charges beyond your plan's limits will be automatically billed using the selected payment method, while the account credit remains untouched.  It's important to monitor your account credit balance and configure additional payment methods as needed to ensure uninterrupted service, especially if your usage may result in charges beyond the plan's limits.

Fungible tokens are the ones that can be exchanged or replaced; for example, a $100 note can easily be exchanged for twenty $5 bills. In contrast, non-fungible tokens cannot be exchanged in the same manner.  For example, gold is fungible since a specified amount of pure gold is equivalent to that same amount of pure gold, whether in the form of coins, ingots, or in other states, whereas a unique item such as gold fashioned into a statue by a famous artist would not be considered fungible. Other fungible commodities include sweet crude oil, company shares, bonds, other precious metals, and currencies.  Fungibility refers only to the equivalence and indistinguishability of each unit of a commodity with other units of the same commodity, and not to the exchange of one commodity for another.  🔗From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Token​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Glossary","url":"/fg-api/docs/misc/glossary#token","content":" A token is a representation of something in the blockchain. This something can be money, time, services, shares in a company, a virtual pet, anything. By representing things as tokens, we can allow smart contracts to interact with them, exchange them, create or destroy them.  Kind of Tokens​  Note that there’s a big difference between having two voting rights and two deeds of ownership: each vote is equal to all others, but houses usually are not! This is called fungibility. Fungible goods are equivalent and interchangeable, like Ether, fiat currencies, and voting rights. Non-fungible goods are unique and distinct, like deeds of ownership, or collectibles.  In a nutshell, when dealing with non-fungibles (like your house) you care about which ones you have, while in fungible assets (like your bank account statement) what matters is how much you have.  Standards​  Even though the concept of a token is simple, they have a variety of complexities in the implementation. Because everything in Ethereum is just a smart contract, and there are no rules about what smart contracts have to do, the community has developed a variety of standards (called EIPs or ERCs) for documenting how a contract can interoperate with other contracts.  ERC20: the most widespread token standard for fungible assets, albeit somewhat limited by its simplicity.ERC721: the de-facto solution for non-fungible tokens, often used for collectibles and games.ERC777: a richer standard for fungible tokens, enabling new use cases and building on past learnings. Backwards compatible with ERC20.ERC1155: a novel standard for multi-tokens, allowing for a single contract to represent multiple fungible and non-fungible tokens, along with batched operations for increased gas efficiency.  🔗From OpenZeppelin Docs  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"ERC1155​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Glossary","url":"/fg-api/docs/misc/glossary#erc1155","content":" ERC1155 is a novel token standard that aims to take the best from previous standards to create a fungibility-agnostic and gas-efficient token contract.  ERC1155 draws ideas from all of ERC20, ERC721, and ERC777. If you’re unfamiliar with those standards, head to their guides before moving on.  The distinctive feature of ERC1155 is that it uses a single smart contract to represent multiple tokens at once. This is why its balanceOf function differs from ERC20’s and ERC777’s: it has an additional id argument for the identifier of the token that you want to query the balance of.  This is similar to how ERC721 does things, but in that standard a token id has no concept of balance: each token is non-fungible and exists or doesn’t. The ERC721 balanceOf function refers to how many different tokens an account has, not how many of each. On the other hand, in ERC1155 accounts have a distinct balance for each token id, and non-fungible tokens are implemented by simply minting a single one of them.  This approach leads to massive gas savings for projects that require multiple tokens. Instead of deploying a new contract for each token type, a single ERC1155 token contract can hold the entire system state, reducing deployment costs and complexity.  🔗From OpenZeppelin Docs ","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Getting started","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/fg-api/docs/intro","content":"","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"Games using Nexus​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Getting started","url":"/fg-api/docs/intro#games-using-nexus","content":" ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"MathSpells Tournament​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Getting started","url":"/fg-api/docs/intro#mathspells-tournament","content":" Wizards casting spells doing mathematical operations.
