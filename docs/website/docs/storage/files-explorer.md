# Files Explorer

Explorer is a tool for browsing the [storage service](../services/storage.md)'s drives, manage files and backups.

## Sections
### Navigation _Section_
It has an action bar that allows you to upload files and create directories. Below there is a navigation bar, and at the end the files and directories.

You can download the files, duplicate them, copy, move or delete them. 

There is no recycle bin, so editing and deleting files cannot be undone.
