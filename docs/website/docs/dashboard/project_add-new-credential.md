# Add New Credential - Project

Credentials are essential for granting secure access to your services from within your games or apps. They consist of a unique **Public Key** and a **Secret**. The Public Key serves as the identifier for the credential and cannot be modified. The Secret, on the other hand, acts as a password and can be regenerated if needed.

### Required Permissions

Please note that only users with **Administrator** privileges can view and access the "Add New Credential" page. If you don't see the menu option at the top-right corner of the window, ensure that you have the appropriate permissions.

### Form fields
- **Alias**: Friendly name for your credentials.
- **Public Key**: Identifier of the credential. This value can never be modified.
- **Secret**: The password of the credential. You can regenerate this value if at any time you think it was exposed.

### Learn more about Credentials
For more detailed information about credentials and how they work, you can visit the  [Credentials Section](../credentials/credential.md).
