# Add New Team Member - Project
This feature enhances collaboration and streamlines teamwork within your projects. 

Invite `team members` to join by providing their email addresses, granting them read-only access. 

This allows `team members`them to stay updated on your game or app's progress, review project details, and offer input without making any modifications. With these view-only privileges, you can foster efficient collaboration and enhance teamwork on your projects.

Additionally, we are planning to introduce extended permission management in the future, which will allow project administrators to have greater control over user permissions, including the ability to grant users the ability to add new elements and make modifications.
