# Settings - Project
The `project settings page` allows you to configure, enable, disable, or delete the project.

You can access `project settings page` using the menu on the [project dashboard](./project.md).

## Activating/Deactivating Projects
You have the option to deactivate your projects, which can be useful for reducing costs when you are not actively using them or for stopping services in case of an emergency. When you deactivate a project, client access is blocked and any requests pointing to the disabled project will be rejected. It's important to note that deactivation is not the same as deleting a project, as you can reactivate the project later if needed.

## Deleting Projects
Deleting a project is a permanent action and cannot be undone. When you delete a project, all data associated with it, including files, settings, and configurations, will be permanently deleted from our system. Therefore, it's important to make sure that you really want to delete the project before proceeding.

If you delete a project by mistake, there's no way to recover it, so it's essential to be careful when choosing to delete a project. We recommend that you double-check that you have backed up any necessary data before deleting a project.

If you're sure that you want to proceed with deleting a project, you can do so by accessing the project's settings and selecting the "Delete project" option. Once you confirm the deletion, the project will be removed from our system, and all data associated with it will be permanently deleted.
