![Gif](/img/dashboard/add_new_project_30fps.gif)

## Overview
Adding a new project to the dashboard is a straightforward process that allows you to use the `Nexus` services for your application or game.

## Form fields
When adding a new project, you'll need to fill in the following form fields:
- **Name:** Name of your project. This is how your project will be identified within the dashboard.
- **Slug:** The URL slug is a unique identifier for your project in the dashboard. It's the part of the URL after the last backslash. For example, the article you’re reading now has a URL that looks like this: 

```
https://forjagames.github.io/fg-api/docs/dashboard/dashboard_add-new-project
```

The URL’s slug is `dashboard_add-new-project`.
