# Leave Project (as Team Member) - Project

## Overview

The **Leave Project** feature allows `team members` to exit a project they are part of, without affecting the project ownership or other members. This functionality is particularly useful for collaborators who no longer wish to be part of a project or have completed their contributions.

## How to Leave a Project

### Steps to Leave a Project

1. **Navigate to the Project Dashboard**: Go to the main dashboard where all your projects are listed.
2. **Select the Project**: Click on the project from which you wish to leave.
3. **Open the Menu**: In the project interface, click on the three vertical dots menu icon located at the top right corner.
4. **Leave the Project**:
    - From the dropdown menu, select the 'Leave Project' option.
    - Confirm your action when prompted to ensure you intend to leave the project.

### Important Notes

- **Project Ownership**: Leaving a project as a team member will not affect the ownership of the project. The project owner and other team members will remain unaffected.
- **Access Rights**: Once you leave the project, you will lose access to its resources, data, and communication channels associated with it.
- **Rejoining the Project**: If you wish to rejoin the project, you will need to be re-invited by the project owner or an authorized team member.
- **Notification**: All project members will be informed through a notification when a user leaves the project.
