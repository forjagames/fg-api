# Billing

In this sectio we will explain Nexus billing.

## Resources
- Bandwidth: bandwidth consumed by each request.
- Requests: calls to different services.
- Storage: storage used both in files by the [Storage Service](../services/storage.md) and in records in our databases.
- Store fee: fee charged for sales made within the blockchain [Store Service](../services/store.md).

## Services

The services are provided with a resource reservation system on demand.

Based on how projects are used, the Nexus system reserves resources so your project can work.

The total of the resources reserved is registered day by day. The costs are applied to the sum of the records since the last payment made.
