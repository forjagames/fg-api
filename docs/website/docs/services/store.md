   - **Name**: Visible name of the product. _It can be changed._
   - **Cost**: Cost in USD. _It can be changed, but may require resynchronization_.
   - **Quantifiable**: If a product is quantifiable, the user can have one or more units. _Example: apples, glasses, glasses_.
If a product is not quantifiable, your purchase is unique per user, and is forever. _Example: "no ads"._ _It cannot be changed._
   - **Consumable**: A consumable product is one that once purchased by the customer, when using it, he loses a unit. _Example: if the person has 3 apples and eats one (consumes one), 2 remain._ _It can be changed._
   - **Transferable**: Allows users to exchange the product (using a [ERC1155](../misc/glossary.md#ERC1155) [Smart Contract](../misc/glossary.md#smart-contract)). _It cannot be changed._
