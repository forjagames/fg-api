# Functions

The `Functions Service` lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers.

## Recipes
`Recipes` represent pre-configured, [serverless](../misc/glossary.md#serverless) [use cases](../misc/glossary.md#use-case) that serve as ready-made building blocks for developers. 

By leveraging tested, reusable components, developers can streamline development efforts, ultimately expediting the creation of high-quality serverless games and applications.

### Key Features
* Efficiency and Accelerated Development: Recipes eliminate the need to reinvent the wheel by offering well-defined, reusable components. Developers can swiftly integrate these building blocks into their serverless applications, reducing development time and effort.

* Customization: While Recipes provide pre-configured solutions, they are also highly customizable. Developers can tailor these components to meet specific project requirements, ensuring flexibility and adaptability.

* Best Practices: Recipes adhere to best practices and industry standards, promoting the creation of robust, efficient, and secure serverless applications.

* Expanding Use Cases: The Recipes library is continuously growing, with plans to cover a multitude of use cases in the future. 

### How to Use Recipes
1. Setup: You can select the desired Recipe from the library, and configure it to align with your project's specifications. 
2. Integration: To integrate them, you can access each Recipe via the Nexus SDK using its respective 'Recipe Instance ID' along with any additional parameters required.
